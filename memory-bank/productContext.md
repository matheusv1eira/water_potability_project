# Product Context

## Purpose

The Water Potability Prediction System exists to provide an accessible and efficient way for users to assess the
potability of water based on key water quality parameters. It leverages machine learning to analyze complex data and
deliver clear, actionable results.

## Problems Solved

- Difficulty in manually assessing water quality and potability.
- Lack of accessible tools for non-experts to evaluate water safety.
- Time-consuming and error-prone traditional water testing methods.
- Need for a reliable, automated prediction system that can assist in water quality monitoring.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input water quality data.
- Deliver fast and accurate predictions of water potability.
- Clearly communicate API status and errors to users.
- Ensure the system is responsive and accessible across devices.
- Build user trust through transparency and reliability of predictions.
