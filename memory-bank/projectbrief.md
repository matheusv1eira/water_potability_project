# Project Brief

## Project Name

Water Potability Prediction System

## Project Purpose

To develop a system that predicts the potability of water based on various water quality parameters using machine
learning.

## Core Requirements

- Build a backend API using Flask that exposes endpoints for water potability prediction.
- Implement a machine learning model (RandomForest) to analyze water quality features.
- Develop a frontend React application for users to input water quality data and view prediction results.
- Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend API and handles API health status.
- Provide a user-friendly interface with clear status and error handling.
- Containerize the application components for easy deployment (Docker support present).

## Goals

- Accurate prediction of water potability based on input features.
- Responsive and intuitive frontend UI.
- Robust backend API with error handling and health checks.
- Maintainable and well-documented codebase.
