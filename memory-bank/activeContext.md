# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Initial setup of the Water Potability Prediction System.
- Backend API development with Flask and machine learning model integration.
- Frontend React application development for user interaction.
- Containerization and deployment setup.

## Recent Changes

- Project structure established with separate backend and frontend directories.
- Flask backend exposing /predict and /health endpoints.
- React frontend with form for input and result display.

## Next Steps

- Complete integration testing between frontend and backend.
- Improve error handling and user feedback in the frontend.
- Enhance machine learning model accuracy and retraining pipeline.
- Add documentation and user guides.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Important Decisions

- Use of RandomForest model for water potability prediction.
- Flask chosen for backend API due to simplicity and flexibility.
- React with Create React App for frontend for rapid development.
- Docker used for containerization to simplify deployment.
